# Review of HW2 by Group 22

Dear Group 22,

Here are some thoughts on your assignment #2:

- Your implementation covers all the assignment requirements, and is concise and overall readable. However, more comments (especially in the Agent module) would make following your code easier
- For more clarity, in your implementation of the agent, I would rename the `take_action` method to `select_action`, and `run` to `train`
- The output of the `visualize` method in Gridworld could be made more appealing to show the different tile types, and the windy tiles with different degrees of "windiness"
- As an extra, it would be nice to have a visualisation of the Q values before and after training. Currently, you have an option of printing the table with the Q values, -- I think if you rounded the values in the table it would already make it more compact and readable

Thank you for your submission!
