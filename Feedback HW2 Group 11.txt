First of all your project structure is a bit unorganized.
Empty readme, empty files and often it is not clear what role which file has.

It was also hard to understand some code blocks and/or the role of some functions or operations since comments were spare.
There were also some commented print statements/commented lines of code. 

I really liked the way the gridworld was printed to the console. That looked nice.

However, I also would have liked a visualization of the Q-values. It would also have been better if the printed values 
for n_of_episodes and ca had some kind of string before them indicating their role.

Best regards,
